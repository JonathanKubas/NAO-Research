## Setting Up Your Environment
To be able to properly run and develope python programs meant to interact with either a physical or virtial NAO robot, or any other support SofBank Robotics robot, the user needs to have properly installed and configured the necessary software. In this case, the two major pieces of software that are needed are the Choregraphe interface and a version of python 2.7. The two sections below describe each of these need tools and goes into depth on how to install and or configure them so that they can be used to program a given NAO robot.

### Choregraphe
The general Chorepgraphe software is an interface that allows users to manipulate a given SoftBank Robotics robot by the use of either block based coding or regular C++ or python scripts. It also allows users to either connect and run their developed programs on either a physical NAO robot or a preinstalled virtual one that can be connected to remotely. If not done so already, the following url provides a link to where users can down load the installation wizard for the Choregraphe software. It is necessary that this IDE is set up properly, so it is imporant that the following steps below are followed when downloading this software:
1. Once the installation wizard is execuated, the following screen will appear:  
2. Accept license agreement:  
3. Choose ___ installation method:  
4. Click finish:
